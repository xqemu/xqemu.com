hero: XQEMU is an open-source emulator to play original Xbox games on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

[XQEMU](https://github.com/xqemu/xqemu) is an open-source, cross-platform,
low-level system emulator for the original Xbox and Sega Chihiro, built on the
excellent [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) project.

XQEMU isn't very usable right now. If you're not a developer you probably
instead want to take a look at [xemu](https://xemu.app/), a fork of XQEMU which
makes different accuracy tradeoffs but has much better performance as-is.
